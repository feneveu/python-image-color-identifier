Most Common Color Finder

This was a quick project where I render a flask website that utilizes PIL and collections to figure out the most
common colors within an image.

How it Works:
On the index.html select a file from your computer and press the upload button from there the page should redirect you
if you have selected a valid image path, then a function in the background sifts through the pixel colors in the image
and from there it makes sure each 'common color' is a certain distance away from each other so there are no colors that
are too close together. 

This was a fairly simple project, I am very familiar with the creation of simple
websites. It was fun learnign about more precise equations to use like 
np.linalg.norm() of which I hadn't used before, and it was fun working with Pillow again.
